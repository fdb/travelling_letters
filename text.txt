Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations for any purpose and any duration, with or without any means of transport. Travel also includes relatively short stays between successive movements. Movements between locations requiring only a few minutes are not considered as travel. As an activity, "travel" also covers all the activities performed during a travel. Travel is a wider concept than a trip. A round trip is a particular type of travel whereby a person moves from his/her usual residence to one or several distant locations and returns. A trip can also be part of a round trip. Travel is most commonly done for recreation or to visit friends and family (generally as part of tourism), for business or for commuting; but may be for numerous other reasons, such as health care, migration, fleeing war, etc. Travel may occur by walking or human-powered mode, or through mechanical vehicles, either as private or public transport. Travel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or international. In some countries, non-local internal travel may require an internal passport, while international travel typically requires a passport and visa.
